# ZeuxTestApiFrontend
Hello dear user! 
To run this app you need to open it in vsstudio. + dotnet core 2.2 on windows machine.  
in wwwroot/app.js you can change api url  apiUrl: "http://localhost:2845/api/v1" ( you won't be able to login without that api. )
Than just start it in vsstudio in debug mode.
